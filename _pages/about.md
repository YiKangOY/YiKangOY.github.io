Currently, I am a second year PhD student at [Microelectronics Thrust](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/function-hub/microelectronics/) of [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof.Yuzhe Ma](https://www.yuzhe-ma.com/). I received my B.S. degree from Sun Yat-sen University in 2022. My research interests are on the cross-disciplinary study of electronic design automation (EDA) and machine learning-aided VLSI design, focusing on modeling and optimization of VLSI designs.
